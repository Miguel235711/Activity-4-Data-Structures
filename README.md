# Acitivity-4-Data-Structures
A small task for Data Structures Class:
This is a small implementation of different approaches to calculate the different COMPLETE matchings of a string pattern P in a string source S, such as brute force O(nm), KMP O(n+m),etc. Moreover, for testing purposes, there is a file called "chlorella_vulgaris.dat",
which can be invoked in the console menu, to calculate the different COMPLETE matchings of a string pattern P in the file content
